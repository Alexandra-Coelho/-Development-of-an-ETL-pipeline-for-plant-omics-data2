cultivar Corvina clone 48 berries were harvested from different vineyards, each located in one of the three most important wine production macro-areas of the Verona region: Bardolino, Valpolicella and Soave, on the basis of the site geographical coordinates. For each of the selected vineyards, specific environmental conditions (altitude and type of soil) and farming and agricultural practices used (training system, rows facing direction, planting layout, vineyard age and rootstock type) were recorded. Vineyards were selected in order to maximize differences in locations and in microenvironmental and farming conditions. Berries were harvested at three different developmental stages: vÃ©raison, mid-ripening and harvest; each sample was collected in three biological replicates, to cover the whole vineyard variability. The same sampling procedure had been repeated over three consecutive vintages (2006, 2007 and 2008).", "samples": {"GSM1020424": "#01_431387_A12_VM081A", "GSM1020425": "#02_388002_A02_VM081B",

All vines were positioned at the same height from the light source. The locations of the individual plants within the growth chamber were recorded.

The expression profile for each bud position was analyzed to determine gene expression patterns linked to the timing of gene expression for inflorescence development. Bud #1 (actually 2nd bud on a cane as the first one was not collected) is the oldest and will express genes involved in later developmental processes. Bud #12 is the youngest and will express genes that are responsible for the earlier processes in inflorescence development. The apical shoot meristem is a control as it does not develop an inflorescence. Biotin labeled probes were prepared from the extracted RNA from pooled green latent buds and apical shoot meristem and hybridized to the Vitis vinifera GeneChip.

One of the goals was to obtain molecular data about the fungus pathogen (Phaeomoniella chlamydospora) during grapevine wood infection.  Grapevine pathogen-infected wood mRNA profiles of 2-month-old plantlets (14 days post infection)  were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq2500. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed by TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRTaPCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped sequence reads to the grapevine genome (build IGGP 12x) and identified pathogen transcripts. RNAseq analyses, using a ribosomal RNA depletion technology for library preparation, provided identification of genes expressed by P. chlamydospora during infection: as for genes related to effector biosynthesis enzymes, carbohydrate-active enzymes and transcription regulators involved in known regulation pathways in fungi. Insights about P. oligandrum modulation of grapevine infection by this pathogen were also found.  Our study represents the first detailed analysis of grapevine wood infection by a fungal pathogen generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles.

Corvina, using RNA pooled from a comprehensive set of sampled tissues in different organs and development steps, and we were able to reconstruct some novel and putative private Corvina genes. We analyzed the expression of these genes in three berry developmental conditions, and posit that they may play some role in the formation of the mature organ. Background: Plants display a high genetic and phenotypic variability among different cultivars. Understanding the genetic components that contribute to phenotypic diversity is necessary to disentangle genetic factors from the environment. Given the high degree of genetic diversity among plant cultivars a whole-genome sequencing and re-annotation of each variety is required but a reliable genome assembly is hindered by the high heterozigosity and sequence divergence. Results: we show the feasibility of an approach based on sequencing of cDNA by RNA-Seq to analyze varietal diversity between a local grape cultivar Corvina and the PN40024 grape reference genome. We detected 15,260 known genes and we annotated alternative splicing isoforms for 9,463 genes. Our approach allowed to define 2,321 protein coding putative novel genes in unannotated or unassembled regions of the reference genome PN40024 and 180 putative private Corvina genes whose sequence is not shared with the reference genome. Conclusions: With a de novo assembly based approach we were able to reconstruct a substantial part of the Corvina transcriptome and we improved substantially known genes annotations by better defining the structure of known genes, annotating splicing isoforms and detecting unannotated genes. Moreover our results clearly define sets of private genes which are likely part of the âdispensableâ genome and potentially involved into influencing some cultivar-specific characteristics. In plant biology a transcriptome de novo assembly approach should not be limited to species where no reference genome is available as it can improve the annotation lead to the identification of genes peculiar of a cultivar.", "samples": {"SRS350575": "RNA pool of 45 samples deriving from different conditions and organs of Vitis vinifera cv.

To elucidate its role in grapevine, we generated transgenic grapevines that overexpress VvWRKY1. Microarray analyses were performed to compare global gene expression in leaves of the transgenic and wild-type lines. Results showed that expression of genes encoding defence-related proteins was enhanced in the transgenic 35S::VvWRKY1 line. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed that three genes putatively involved in jasmonic acid signalling pathway, two genes encoding JASMONATE ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins and one lipoxygenase, are over-expressed. The ability of VvWRKY1 to trans-activate their corresponding promoters was confirmed by transient expression assay in grape protoplasts. After challenging with the downy mildew pathogen Plasmopara viticola, resistance was enhanced in the transgenic line compared to the wild-type line.

Optimal oenological maturity of berries is characterized by a high sugar/acidity ratio, high anthocyanin content in the skin, and low astringency. However, harvest time is still mostly determined empirically, based on crude biochemical composition and berry tasting. In this context, it is interesting to identify genes that are expressed/repressed specifically at the late stages of ripening and which may be used as indicators of maturity. Results: Whole bunches and berries sorted by density were collected in vineyard on Chardonnay (white cultivar) grapevines for two consecutive years at three stages of ripening (7-days before harvest (TH-7),harvest (TH), and 10-days after harvest (TH+10)). Microvinification and sensory analysis indicate that the quality of the wines made from the whole bunches collected at TH-7, TH and TH+10 differed, TH providing the highest quality wines. In parallel, gene expression was studied with Qiagen/Operon microarrays using two types of samples, i.e. whole bunches and berries sorted by density. Only 12 genes were consistently up- or down-regulated in whole bunches and density sorted berries for the two years studied in Chardonnay. 52 genes were differentially expressed between the TH-7 and TH samples. In order to determine whether these genes followed a similar pattern of expression during the late stagesof berry ripening in a red cultivar, nine genes were selected for RT-PCR analysis with Cabernet Sauvignon grown under two different temperature regimes affecting the precocity of ripening. The expression profiles and their relationship to ripening were confirmed in Cabernet Sauvignon for seven genes, encoding a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase, a galactinol synthase, a late embryogenesis abundant protein, a dirigent-like protein, a histidine kinase receptor, avalencene synthase and a putative S-adenosyl-L-methionine:salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase. Conclusions: This set of up- and down-regulated genes characterize the late stages of berry ripening in the two cultivars studied, and are indirectly linked to wine quality.
